# Domain Entity Identification  
The specific domain chosen is "Tweets Related to FIFA World Cup 2018".  
The aim is to compare different techniques in Named Entity Recognition for the domain.  
  
## Dataset:  
The zipped dataset alongwith the datasets used for annotating.  
There are 530k Tweets related to FIFA World Cup 2018.  
  
## Annotated Dataset:  
The code and required annotated dataset for 530k Tweets on FIFA World Cup 2018. The dataset has each of them POS tagged, and also tagged by NER.  
  
## Approaches:  
### n-gram Frequency  
Extracts the domain entities based on the n-gram frequency approach in the dataset.  
The dataset may be in CSV or text format. Give relative path of dataset w.r.t. script in the notebook.  
If not in CSV format, keep the first line as header.  
It also contains an accuracy checker.  
### Deep Learning  
NER.ipynb is the complete notebook.    
NER_deep_learning.ipynb only has the deep learning part for quick experimentation and additions.  

## References & Data Sources:
